Warning: this project halted about 9 years ago (in 2006) and I do not intend
to ever bring it back.  The name Sage was a tribute to the stillborn Sage
geometrical processor intended to accompany the never-released 3dfx Rampage.

This is an open-source implementation of the OpenGL specification, a system
for rendering interactive 3D graphics.  Its semblance to Mesa in design (and
possibly some parts of code) is due to my involvement with Mesa at that time.

I can't remember if it ever outperformed Mesa, as this project was primarily
a sandbox for my experiments to overcome shortcomings of the then-already-aged
3dfx cards: npot/large/compressed textures, fake/skipping some tcl stages,
unsupported blending modes, etc.
